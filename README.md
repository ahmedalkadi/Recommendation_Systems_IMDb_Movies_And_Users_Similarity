## Recommender Systems: Movies and Users' Recommendations
### Project Overview
#### This project involves developing two models for a movie recommendation system:

- Movie Similarity Model: Calculates movie similarity based on features using cosine similarity.
- User Recommendation Model: Recommends movies to users by predicting their ratings, leveraging user-rating history with matrix factorization.
## Objectives
- Movie Similarity Model: Identify and recommend movies that are similar based on their features.
- User Recommendation Model: Predict user ratings for movies to provide personalized recommendations.
## Tools and Technologies
- PyTorch: For implementing and training the matrix factorization model.
- Scikit-learn: For calculating cosine similarity and other preprocessing tasks.
